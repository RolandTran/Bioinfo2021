 1b) Ans 1b: We cross with a homozygous recessive animal to determine if an organism exhibiting a dominant trait is homozygous or heterozygous for a specific allele.

 2b ans: 8 different gametes can be produced by the parent AaBbCc: ABC, ABc, AbC. Abc, aBC, aBc, abC, abc.

 2b) The university of employment has to be a member of the consortium and one has to follow a list of guidelines. Much information is cryptic.
